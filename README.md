## CV Maker

A React application which takes users data inputs, and prints a CV using the entered data. This project uses controlled forms, hooks and allowed me to practice using the Context API State Management. The CV printing feature was built with JavaScript, although it does this with minimal styling. The idea was to implement a CV template builder that quickly creates a CV without too many features.

## Lessons Learned

This project was an extension of what I already learned in the Note Keeper app (using Hooks). However, I wanted to practise using Context API, which I had just spent time learning about. After successfully applying Context into the app, I immediately valued how much cleaner it was to manage states. The state management feature was definitely something I would be using in larger React applications due to how effective it is to organise global states in one file, rather than duplicate them in multiple places.

Overall, the app works how I planned but I wasn’t impressed with the lack of styling when a user attempts to print the CV. This is an area of the project I will be revisiting.

## Future Updates

• Include a feature which allows users to print off a styled copy of the CV.

• Styling feature could allow users to choose how to style their CV (font colours, background etc).

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
